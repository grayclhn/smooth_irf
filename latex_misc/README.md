latex-tools
===========

Files that I typically need to include in LaTeX documents.

* `references.bib` - a comprehensive BibTeX database
* `tcilatex.tex` - LaTeX file that's necessary when coauthors use
  Scientific Word
* `version_git.sh` and `version_git.make` - commands to generate
  git version information in a format that can be used inside
  LaTeX files.

Usage
=====

The LaTeX files are straightforward. For the Git version information,
I put something like the following in my makefile:

```{make}
.PHONY: VERSION.tex
VERSION.tex:
	echo "\newcommand\VERSION{$$(./version_git.sh)}" > $@
mainpaper.pdf: mainpaper.tex VERSION.tex
	# Commands
```

and then the following goes in `mainpaper.tex`

```{latex}
\input{VERSION}
\date{\VERSION}
\pagestyle{fancy}
\fancyhead[LE,LO]{\small\slshape\VERSION}
\fancyhead[RE,RO]{\small\slshape\leftmark}
```
