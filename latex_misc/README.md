latex_misc overview
===================

This directory contains a BibTeX database and LaTeX macros that I use
in my research (I'm Gray Calhoun). If it's useful, feel free to use it
yourself. The latest version of these files should be available at

<https://git.ece.iastate.edu/gcalhoun/latex_misc>

as a self-contained Git repository. Please contact me if you find
errors, either by email, <gcalhoun@iastate.edu>, or by filing a bug
report at <https://git.ece.iastate.edu/gcalhoun/latex_misc/issues>.

The current version is 2.0.0 and the files were last modified on
February 9, 2015
