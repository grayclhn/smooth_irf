latex-tools
===========

Files that I typically need to include in LaTeX documents.

* `references.bib` - a comprehensive BibTeX database
* `tcilatex.tex` - LaTeX file that's necessary when coauthors use
  Scientific Word

License and copyright information depend on the specific files. Look
at each file for details.
